Here’s a simple “Hello, World!” function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef hello_world():\n    return \"Hello, World!\"\n```\n\nYou can call this function using `hello_world()` and it will return the string `\"Hello, World!\"`. If you want it to print directly instead of returning, you can modify it to:\n\n```python\ndef hello_world():\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\nLet me know if you’d like to see an example of calling the function or writing tests for it!","role":"assistant","schema_version":1}
